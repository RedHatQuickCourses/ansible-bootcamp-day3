= Lab: Creating a CI/CD Pipeline

We will create a complete CI/CD pipeline for Ansible collection development using Tekton on OpenShift. This includes building a pipeline that automatically lints, tests, builds, publishes, and approves Ansible collections to Private Automation Hub, with webhook integration for automated triggering on git commits.

== Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Understand CI/CD concepts and their application to Ansible automation
- Create and configure Tekton pipelines in OpenShift
- Set up automated testing and linting for Ansible collections
- Implement automated publishing workflows to Private Automation Hub
- Configure webhook integrations for git-triggered deployments
- Monitor and troubleshoot CI/CD pipeline execution
